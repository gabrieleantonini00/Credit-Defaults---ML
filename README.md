# Credit-Defaults---ML

In this project I used a logit to measure the credit risk of P2P lending loans by analysing a public dataset published on Kaggle:

The code, written in python, is particularly flexible and can be adapted to several other ML models (random forest, SVM, ...)

Since it is one of my first projects involving ML some minor issues are possible. 

Libraries used:


- Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- Matplot
